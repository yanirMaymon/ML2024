Student Performance Index\n","\n","In this assignment, we will build models to predict student's performance. We will be using the \"Student Performance Dataset\" a dataset which includes student grades, demographic, social and school related features that has been collected by using school reports and questionnaires.\n","You can download the dataset from the moodle. You can also read on the dataset from [the UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/320/student+performance).\n","\n","Our target value will be the student's performance in the end of the year which is marked 'G3' in the dataset. In the first part of the assignment you will be writing a linear regression model to predict the students grade at the end of the year. In the second part of the assignment you will build a classifier which predicts if the student's performance at the end of the year will be above average.\n","\n","The assignment includes two files.\n","1. This file (ML_DL_Assignment1.ipynb)\n","2. A python utils file which you will fill out (ML_DL_Functions1.py)\n","\n","As well as the student performance dataset file.\n","\n","In this assignment you will mount and load the dataset and functions file from google drive. To start make sure you have both the template python functions file and the student dataset file on the same directory in your google drive.\n","\n","\n","**IMPORTANT:**\n","When you are finished with the assignment make sure you submit both ipynb file and the functions file flat (**NOT inside a directory**). Do not change the files names(ML_DL_Assignment1.ipynb, and ML_DL_Functions1.py).
